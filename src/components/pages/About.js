      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a recent graduate of the Johns Hopkins University with a Bachelors
        of Science in Neuroscience. I completed my undergraduate degree with a
        pre-med track, but upon graduation I decided that medical school wasn't
        for me. As a neuroscience major, I've learned much about the human
        nervous system, but my recent coursework has shifted my interests
        towards healthcare and technology. My rich background in neuroscience,
        physics, and biochemistry has supplemented my experience in the
        healthcare industry. Additionally, I enjoy problem-solving and working
        with other people. I'd like to put these skills to use to further any
        organization that I become a part of.
